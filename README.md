Data Analytics Advanced Project
# Automated-Data-Pipeline-with-ETL-Tools

## 📖 Project Description

The **Automated Data Pipeline** streamlines the process of data extraction, transformation, and loading by using Prefect’s task-based architecture.  
It ensures each step of your workflow (Extract → Transform → Load) is monitored, logged, and easily scalable — locally or in the cloud.

**Dataset Used:**

## 🧩 Tech Stack

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Prefect 2.x** (Workflow orchestration)
- **Pandas** (Data manipulation)
- **Docker Desktop** (Optional – containerized execution)
- **VS Code** (Development environment)

## 🏗️ ETL Workflow Overview

| Step | Process | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Extract** | 🧮 | Reads raw CSV files from a folder and loads them into Pandas DataFrames. |
| **Transform** | 🔄 | Cleans, filters, and prepares data for analytics (handles missing values, renames columns, etc.). |
| **Load** | 💾 | Exports the cleaned dataset to a `processed_data.csv` file (or database). |
